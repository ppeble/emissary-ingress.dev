# Diagnostics

If you're experiencing issues with $productName$, log in to your Edge Policy Console and choose from the left menu whether you want to:

* Debug issues from the Debugging tab
* Check the health status of your services from the Mappings tab

## Debugging

If $productName$ is not routing your services as you'd expect, your first step should be $productName$ Diagnostics in the Edge Policy Console. Login to your Edge Policy Console and select the "Debugging" tab from the left menu.

Some of the most important information (your $productName$ version, how recently $productName$'s configuration was updated, and how recently Envoy last reported status to $productName$) is right at the top. See [Debugging](../debugging) for more information.

## Health status

$productName$ displays the health of your services on the Dashboard of your Edge Policy Console. Health is computed as successful requests / total requests and expressed as a percentage. The "total requests" comes from Envoy `upstream_rq_pending_total` stat. "Successful requests" is calculated by substracting `upstream_rq_4xx` and `upstream_rq_5xx` from the total.

* Red is used when the success rate ranges from 0% - 70%.
* Yellow is used when the success rate ranges from 70% - 90%.
* Green is used when the success rate is > 90%.
* Grey is used when a service is "waiting". This means the success rate cannot be determined because the service has not recieved any requests yet.

The LEFT image shows what a list of services under the `Debugging tab` in the Edge Policy Consul will look like for each level of health.

The RIGHT image shows the dial on the hompage of the Edge Policy Console, this will display the ratio of services that are healthy according to these measurements.


## Troubleshooting

If the diagnostics service does not provide sufficient information, Kubernetes and Envoy provide additional debugging information.

If $productName$ isn't working at all, start by looking at the data from the following:

* `kubectl describe pod <ambassador-pod>` will give you a list of all events on the $productName$ pod
* `kubectl logs <ambassador-pod> ambassador` will give you a log from $productName$ itself

If you need additional help, feel free to join our [Slack channel](http://a8r.io/slack) with the above information (along with your Kubernetes manifest).

You can also increase the debug of Envoy through the button in the diagnostics panel. Turn on debug logging, issue a request, and capture the log output from the $productName$ pod using `kubectl logs` as described above.
