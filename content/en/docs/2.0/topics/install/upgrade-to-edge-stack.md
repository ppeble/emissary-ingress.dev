# Upgrade to $AESproductName$

<Alert severity="info">
  We're pleased to introduce $productName$ 2.0! The 2.X family introduces a number of
  changes to allow $productName$ to more gracefully handle larger installations (including
  multitenant or multiorganizational installations), reduce memory footprint, and improve
  performance. In keeping with [SemVer](https://semver.org), $productName$ 2.X introduces
  some changes that aren't backward-compatible with 1.X, so <b>some configuration has
  changed</b> between 1.X and 2.X: if you're currently running 1.X, <b>please</b> read
  the <a href="../migrate-to-version-2/">migration guide</a> before trying to install 2.0.<br/>
  <br/>
  For more information on 2.X, please check the <a href="../../../release-notes">release notes</a>.
</Alert>

If you currently have the open source version of $OSSproductName$, you can upgrade to $AESproductName$ with a few simple commands. When you upgrade to $AESproductName$, you'll be able to access additional capabilities such as **automatic HTTPS/TLS termination, Swagger/OpenAPI support, API catalog, Single Sign-On, and more.** For more about the differences between $AESproductName$ and $OSSproductName$, see the [Editions page](/editions).

**Prerequisites**:

* You must have properly installed $OSSproductName$ previously following [these](../) instructions.
* You must have TLS configured and working properly on your $OSSproductName$ instance

**To upgrade your instance of $OSSproductName$**:

1. [Apply the migration manifest](#1-apply-the-migration-manifest)
2. [Test the new Deployment](#2-test-the-new-deployment)
3. [Redirect traffic](#3-redirect-traffic)
4. [Delete the old Deployment](#4-delete-the-old-deployment)
5. [Update and restart](#5-update-and-restart)
6. [What's next?](

## Before you begin

Make sure that you follow the steps in the given order - not doing that might crash your $OSSproductName$ installation or make it inconsistent.

Check if you have an [`AuthService`](../../running/services/auth-service) or
[`RateLimitService`](../../running/services/rate-limit-service) installed. If
you do, make sure that they are using the [namespace-qualified DNS name](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/#namespaces-of-services).
If they are not, the initial migration tests may fail.

## 1. Apply the migration manifest

First, install $AESproductName$ alongside your existing $OSSproductName$ installation so you can test your workload against the new deployment.

Note: Make sure you apply the manifests in the same namespace as your current $OSSproductName$ installation.

Use the following command to install $AESproductName$, replacing `<namespace>` appropriately:

```
kubectl apply -n <namespace> -f https://app.getambassador.io/yaml/edge-stack/$version$/oss-migration.yaml
```

## 2. Test the new Deployment

At this point, you have $OSSproductName$ and $AESproductName$ running side by side in your cluster. $AESproductName$ is configured using the same configuration (Mappings, Modules, etc) as your current $OSSproductName$.

Get the IP address to connect to $AESproductName$ by running the following command:

```
kubectl get service test-aes -n <namespace>
```

Test that $AESproductName$ is working properly.

## 3. Redirect traffic

Once youâ€™re satisfied with the new deployment, begin to route traffic to $AESproductName$.

Edit the current $OSSproductName$ service with `kubectl edit service -n <namespace> emissary-ingress` and change the selector to `product: aes`.

## 4. Delete the old Deployment

You can now safely delete the older $OSSproductName$ deployment and $AESproductName$ service.

```
kubectl delete deployment -n <namespace> emissary-ingress
kubectl delete service -n <namespace> test-aes
```

## 5. Update and restart

Apply the new CRDs, resources and restart the $AESproductName$ pod for changes to take effect:

```
kubectl apply -n <namespace> -f https://app.getambassador.io/yaml/edge-stack/$version$/aes-crds.yaml && \
kubectl apply -n <namespace> -f https://app.getambassador.io/yaml/edge-stack/$version$/resources-migration.yaml && \
kubectl rollout -n <namespace> restart deployment/aes
```

## 6. What's next?

Now that you have $AESproductName$ up and running, check out the [Getting Started](../../../tutorials/getting-started) guide for recommendations on what to do next and take full advantage of its features.
