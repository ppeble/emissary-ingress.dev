# Installing $productName$

<Alert severity="info">
  We're pleased to introduce $productName$ 2.0! The 2.X family introduces a number of
  changes to allow $productName$ to more gracefully handle larger installations
  (including multitenant or multiorganizational installations), reduce memory footprint,
  and improve performance. For more information on 2.X, please check the&nbsp;
  <a href="../../release-notes">release notes</a>.
</Alert>

## <img class="os-logo" src="../../images/helm-navy.png"/> Install via Helm
Helm, the package manager for Kubernetes, is the recommended way to install
$productName$. Full details are in the [Helm instructions.](helm/)

## <img class="os-logo" src="../../images/kubernetes.png"/> Install via Kubernetes YAML
Another way to install $productName$ if you are unable to use Helm is to
directly apply Kubernetes YAML. See details in the
[manual YAML installation instructions.](yaml-install).

## <img class="os-logo" src="../../images/docker.png"/> Install Locally on Docker
The Docker install will let you try the $productName$ locally in seconds,
but is not supported for production workloads. [Try $productName$ on Docker.](docker/)

## Upgrade Options
If you already have an existing installation of $AESproductName$ or
$OSSproductName$, you can upgrade your instance:

1. [Upgrade to $AESproductName$ from $OSSproductName$](upgrade-to-edge-stack/).
2. [Upgrade your $productName$ instance](upgrading/) to the latest version.

## Container Images
Although our installation guides will favor using the `docker.io` container registry,
we publish $AESproductName$ and $OSSproductName$ releases to multiple registries.

Starting with version 1.0.0, you can pull the emissary image from any of the following registries:
- `docker.io/emissaryingress/`
- `gcr.io/datawire/`

We want to give you flexibility and independence from a hosting platform's uptime to support
your production needs for $AESproductName$ or $OSSproductName$. Read more about
[Running $productName$ in Production](../running).

# Whatâ€™s Next?
$productName$ has a comprehensive range of [features](/features/) to
support the requirements of any edge microservice. To learn more about how $productName$ works, along with use cases, best practices, and more,
check out the [Welcome page](../../../) or read the [$productName$
Story](../../about/why-ambassador).
